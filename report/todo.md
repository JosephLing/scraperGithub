- comments 
  - raitos of comments to line and code per config

future:
- proof read again and again (specailly with a fresh pair of eyes)
- conclusion and abstract need TLC
- decide if the first two graphs should go side by side or not, specailly as page 8 currently just seems to be one graph....
- scripts percentages
- graph axis labelling not working it is being cut off
- bar graph done properly
  - x axis labelling being clearer
    - review write up to put some numbers to this when this is done!!!
    - note: all 3 graphs use the same method to render them so it should be a case of fixing in one place
  - drawing a nice pretty line to show the gradient or at least caculate it
- look into spec to see if columns is a thing or if that would take too much time
- naming convention
- verbatims having better styling and hopefully syntax highlighting maybe (push goal for syntax highlighting)
- look into a better way to represent the yaml configuration errors table (highlighting and percentages or grouped bar graph)


done:
- labels
- look into how to compare with other paper properly as currently they are using similar method but not the same
- comments 
  - size 
- threats section needs writing
    - rewrite sections that had this in to ahve a more concise flow through it
- scripts usage


conclusion notes:
  we have reasoned about usage in terms of types of project (haven't done programmign language I dont think in this so far but do have the graph)



  agreed with past research in the area
    with the slight side note on subscirber
  
  ---------
  looked at usage of comments

  what kind of errors typically happen in terms of yaml for CI

  are scripts used more or less depending on the code count

  key take away - that a lot CI uses in built stuff and doesn't use comments
