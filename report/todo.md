  - raitos of comments to line and code per config

- threats section needs writing
    - rewrite sections that had this in to ahve a more concise flow through it

- proof read
- conclusion




future:
- graph axis labelling not working it is being cut off
- bar graph done properly
  - x axis labelling being clearer
    - review write up to put some numbers to this when this is done!!!
    - note: all 3 graphs use the same method to render them so it should be a case of fixing in one place
  - drawing a nice pretty line to show the gradient or at least caculate it
- look into spec to see if columns is a thing or if that would take too much time
- naming convention
- verbatims having better styling and hopefully syntax highlighting maybe (push goal for syntax highlighting)
- look into a better way to represent the yaml configuration errors table (highlighting and percentages or grouped bar graph)


done:
- labels
- look into how to compare with other paper properly as currently they are using similar method but not the same
